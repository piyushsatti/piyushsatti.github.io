summary: "Proposes a denoising filter using min–max average pooling to better handle salt-and-pepper (impulse) noise. Improves signal quality while preserving edges by selectively pooling neighborhood statistics."

**Plain-English:** A compact image filter that detects and cleans “impulse” specks in pictures without blurring details. It leverages both min and max neighborhood values and averages them in a principled way to restore pixels robustly.
