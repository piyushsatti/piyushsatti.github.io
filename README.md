# Piyush Satti — Terminal Portfolio

This repository contains the source for [piyushsatti.github.io](https://piyushsatti.github.io), a personal site built with Astro and the retro terminal-inspired Astro Terminal theme. It hosts long-form writing, project case studies, research summaries, and resume links in a single static site that deploys automatically to GitHub Pages.

## ✨ Highlights

- Astro 5 static site with light/dark terminal theming and keyboard-inspired UI
- Content powered by Astro Content Collections (`blog`, `projects`, `research`) with type-safe frontmatter
- Global tagging system with `/tags` index and per-tag landing pages across all collections
- Downloadable resume, contact links, and themed components that respect the original Terminal design
- Optimised for GitHub Pages deployment via the default Astro build output

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- [Astro 5](https://astro.build/) with the Astro Terminal theme
- Astro Content Collections for structured Markdown/MDX content
- Shiki syntax highlighting and custom CSS modules under `src/styles`
- Continuous deployment on GitHub Pages (see `.github/workflows` if customised)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js **18** or newer (Astro requirement)
- npm (bundled with Node) or pnpm/yarn if you prefer

### Install & Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/piyushsatti/piyushsatti.github.io.git
cd piyushsatti.github.io
npm install
npm run dev
```

Astro serves the site at [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321) with hot module reload.

### Build & Preview Production Output

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The build step generates static HTML in `dist/`. `npm run preview` serves that output locally to mirror production.

## ✍️ Managing Content Collections

All content lives in [Astro Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) defined in `src/content/config.ts`. Frontmatter is type-checked at build time.

### Blog (`src/content/blog`)

```md
---
title: "REST vs GraphQL: Lessons from Risk-Emulated"

### Projects (`src/content/projects`)

### Adding a New Entry

1. Pick the collection directory (`blog`, `projects`, or `research`).
2. Create a new `.md` or `.mdx` file with a unique slug (file name becomes the slug).
3. Copy the relevant frontmatter template above and adjust the fields.
4. `npm run dev` or `npm run build` to validate the schema — Astro will flag missing required fields.

### Creating Additional Collections

If you need more content types (e.g., `talks`):

1. Update `src/content/config.ts` with a new `defineCollection` schema.
2. Create `src/content/talks/` and add Markdown files that match the schema.
3. Add route/pages under `src/pages/talks/` or components that consume the collection.
4. Extend utilities like `src/lib/tags.ts` if the new collection should participate in tag aggregation.

## 🏷 Working with Tags

- Tags are simple strings in frontmatter (`tags: ["GraphQL", "DDD"]`).
- `src/lib/tags.ts` aggregates tags across **all** collections and powers:
  - `/tags` – directory of every tag with counts.
  - `/tags/<slug>` – landing page showing posts, projects, and research entries for that tag.
- Slugs are generated automatically (lowercase, kebab-case) via `slugifyTag`. When linking manually, prefer `<a href={`/tags/${slugifyTag(tag)}/`}>` in components.

## 🎨 Customisation Notes

The project keeps the Astro Terminal aesthetic intact. Customisations focus on content, not re-skinning.

- **Theme variables** live in `src/styles/terminal.css`. Update CSS variables to tweak colours.
- **Fonts** are configured in `src/styles/fonts.css` (currently using Fira Code).
- **Navigation** is controlled in `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`.
- **Resume** lives in `public/resume.pdf` and is linked from the navigation/footer.

## 📤 Deployment

The site is designed for GitHub Pages:

1. Ensure `astro.config.mjs` has `site: "https://piyushsatti.github.io"`.
2. Run `npm run build` locally to validate.
3. Push to the default branch; the GitHub Actions workflow (if enabled) will build and publish to Pages.

You can also host the `dist/` folder on any static host (Netlify, Vercel static export, Cloudflare Pages, etc.).

## ✅ Maintenance Checklist

- `npm run dev` while editing content for instant feedback.
- `npm run build` before committing to catch schema or runtime errors.
- Keep `resume.pdf` updated in `public/`.
- Refresh social metadata (OpenGraph, JSON-LD) when adding new content types.
